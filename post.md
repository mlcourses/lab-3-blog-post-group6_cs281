# Lab 3: Ramp Circuit

## Overview and Motivation
This lab will introduce us to changing numbers on a LED display using a knob. Specifically, we will use a potentiometer to change the resistance of a voltage divider, which in turn change the numbers on the LED display. The lab will arm us with background and skills in combinational logic, analog and digital input and output, SOP designs and Boolean Simplification, as well as electrical components such as resistors and Ohm's Law. Since the circuit is complex, it helps us practice wiring and color coding skills.
## Materials
Like other labs, we will need a PB-503 breadboard and an Arduino. We also need a 7-segment LED display that can show numbers from 0-5 using combinational circuits.

## Project Steps
### Arduino and Potentiometer
Before diving into building the complex combinational circuits, we need to make sure the Potentiometer is giving correct analog input, and the Arduino correctly converts the input from the pot into digital output. We start by connecting the V output of the potentiometer to the A0 pin on the Arduino
